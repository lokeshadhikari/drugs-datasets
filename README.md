# Drug banks crawler and ATC-ICD codes identifier algorithms
Data Descriptor: Drugs, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, Diseases and Side Effects databases, a resource for analysis on drugs-illness interaction.

This repository contains the Python and R scripts for the drug banks web crawler and ATC-ICD codes identifier algorithms described in the paper [_"Data Descriptor: Drugs, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Diseases databases, a resource for exposure-relevant data on diversification of the drug for decision-making"_](https://XXXX.XXX) by Irene López, César F. Reyes, Israel Reyes and Lev Guzmán.

## Requirements
The algorithms work for version of R > 3.3 and Python >  2.7.
Other necessary packages will automatically be added in the installation.

## Installation
To install the last version of the package in Python run
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3.7 pip3.7
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install SQLAlchemy
```

## Running the Algorithm
Here are the basic steps for using our algorithm :
```
python get_full_data.py
```
Here are the basic steps for using the Jupyter Notebook :
1. Click on the Jupyter notebook called Technical Validation.ipynb
2. You can download the notebook and run it in your computer or open it on Nbviewer http://nbviewer.ipython.org/
